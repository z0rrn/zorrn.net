## Programming languages

-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   Basic Lua

## This site

Built with Zola and the Duckquill theme.

## Devices

-   Sony Vaio PCG-81312M (from about 2011 but with 8 gigs of ram running
    perfectly with XFCE, 2x VSCode and Chrome)
-   Pixel 6a

## Software

-   [MX Linux](https://mxlinux.org/) and the Linux Terminal - lightweight enough for my laptop
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - decent VCS
-   [Neovim](https://neovim.io) with [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) or
    [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/) - recently switched here cause I like
    keyboard nav
-   [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) with [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) -
    I only have two plugins: zsh-syntax-highlighting and zsh-autosuggestions. I
    copied zgen into my dotfiles and never need to worry again.

## Services

-   [GitHub](https://github.com) - where I host my code
-   [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) - easy and free password manager
-   [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) - cheap and really good email and web hosting
-   [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) - domain registrar, DNS and static
    site hosting.

## Most used desktop apps

-   Chrome / Firefox - best browsers with a few exetnsions (like UBlock Origin)
-   Terminal - mostly Neovim and Git
-   VSCode - I don't use it as much anymore but it's still installed
-   Thunderbird - email client
-   Obsidian - for private notes or drafts
