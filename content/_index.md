# Moin to my blog!

Hiya, I'm Frederik or zorrn/z0rrn (zorrn is actually not available on a
lot of sites). I write here to help my soul, maybe improve my wiriting and
cause it's fun, otherwise I like playing handball!

My projects are mostly private, but I'm trying to open up more. My projects are
on the GitHub down ‚Üì.  
I hope you enjoy it here. Write me if you'd like... I'll respond.

yours,  
your friend

## My links and stuff

Just to verify you're not interacting with my evil twin, here are some links to
my profiles:

email: `fz üêå zorrn.net`  
github: <https://github.com/z0rrn>  
npm: <https://www.npmjs.com/~zorrn>  
dockerhub: <https://hub.docker.com/u/zorrn>  
bluesky and fediverse: maybe soon‚Ñ¢

Please don't be shy and write me! I want to help or just chat.

Otherwise I mostly link back to GitHub or this site.

A funny cartoon by the peanuts:
Snoopy starts a story: "It was a dark and stormy night.",
Lucy interrupts: "That's a terrible way to start a story! 'Once upon a time...'
that's the way all good stories begin.",
Snoopy starts again: "Once upon a time, it was a dark and stormy night."
