-   [Hugo-Install](https://github.com/z0rrn/hugo-install) - Another Hugo
    install-with-node script because it was fun and only this one works with
    <https://bun.sh>.
-   [Anki Sync-Server Docker Image](https://github.com/z0rrn/docker-anki-sync-server) - There
    was no premaid one and this one updates itself.
-   A few [Proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto)
    [Plugins](https://github.com/z0rrn/proto-plugins) - Proto is currently my
    favorite tool manager because it works on all systems is really easy and
    writing plugins is fun.
